### Areas to focus on

1. Resume -
  1. It needs to exist at least
  2. Better than that it needs to shine a bit
2. Coding interviews -
  1. These are optional, but if you need interview practice they will
  be available
3. Whiteboarding -
  1. also optional, I can't force you to do something you don't want
  to do, but you came here to practice coding...
4. 15 hours a week for the next 3 months
  1. yup 3 more months and then you know a job doing that same thing
  that's gonna be a lot more than 15 hours a week.
